psychopy-experiments
====================

past and current psychology experiments programmed in psychopy

I am putting all my experiment programs for Psychopy up for free distribution.
My hopes are that other researchers will be able to quickly and easily benefit from my work,
hopefully creating a network of experimental software free to use so less time is wasted
rewriting the same programs and more time is spent getting data.
